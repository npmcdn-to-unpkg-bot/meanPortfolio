                   I have a passion for web development. Solving backend challenges and producing a sensible
                    and creative front-end user experience engages my brain in a way that I have always craved
                    in my educational and professional experience.

                     Climbing has always been an immense source of happiness in my life. Through it I have met life-long friends, released stress, kept in
                    shape, and challenged my mind and body. I have a great worklife balance, which allows me to be more productive both in the office and
                    and on the side of a cliff. Climbing has always been an immense source of happiness in my life. Through it I have met life-long friends, released stress, kept in
